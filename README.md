# Final project for CM2020 Agile Software Projects

For now project consists of REACT.js frontend and Express.js backend. Right now only documents upload API is available on the backend. 

To install all packges for both frontend and backend use 
```
npm install
```

Backend can be started on port 3000 from the `/server` directory using:
```
npm run start
```

Documents upload API can be tested using Postman collection inside `/postman` directory. Server is going to store uploaded files inside `/server/uploads` directory which it is  going to create if it does not exist.
